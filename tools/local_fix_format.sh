# Runs the Envoy format fixers on the current changes. By default, this runs on
# changes that are not yet committed. You can also specify:
#
#   -all: runs on the entire repository (very slow)
#   -main: runs on the changes made from the main branch
#   file1 file2 file3...: runs on the specified files.
#
# To effectively use this script, it's best to run the format fixer before each
# call to 'git commit'.  If you forget to do that then you can run with "-main"
# and it will run on all changes you've made since branching from main, which
# will still be relatively fast.
#
# To run this script, you must provide several environment variables:
#
# CLANG_FORMAT     -- points to the clang formatter binary, perhaps found in
#                     $CLANG_TOOLCHAIN/bin/clang-format
# BUILDIFIER_BIN   -- buildifier location, perhaps found in $HOME/go/bin/buildifier
# BUILDOZER_BIN    -- buildozer location, perhaps found in $HOME/go/bin/buildozer

# If DISPLAY is set, then tkdiff pops up for some BUILD changes.
