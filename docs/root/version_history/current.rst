New Features
------------

* http: added the ability to :ref:`unescape slash sequences<envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.path_with_escaped_slashes_action>` in the path. Requests with unescaped slashes can be proxied, rejected or redirected to the new unescaped path. By default this feature is disabled. The default behavior can be overridden through :ref:`http_connection_manager.path_with_escaped_slashes_action<config_http_conn_man_runtime_path_with_escaped_slashes_action>` runtime variable. This action can be selectively enabled for a portion of requests by setting the :ref:`http_connection_manager.path_with_escaped_slashes_action_sampling<config_http_conn_man_runtime_path_with_escaped_slashes_action_enabled>` runtime variable.
