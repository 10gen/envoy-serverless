## Docker cache
#
# This workflow will only prime the cache, and should be done separately first, prior
# to any jobs that require it.
#
# For a job that does, you can restore with something like:
#
#    steps:
#    - uses: envoyproxy/toolshed/gh-actions/docker/cache/restore@actions-v0.0.5
#      with:
#        key: "${{ needs.env.outputs.build_image_ubuntu }}"
#

jobs:
  docker:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
    - uses: envoyproxy/toolshed/gh-actions/docker/cache/prime@actions-v0.0.7
      with:
        image_tag: "${{ inputs.image_tag }}"
