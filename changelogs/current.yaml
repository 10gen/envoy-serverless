  change: |
    Enable QUICHE request and response headers validation. This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.FLAGS_envoy_quic_reloadable_flag_quic_act_upon_invalid_header`` to false.

# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: connection limit
  change: |
    fixed a use-after-free bug in the connection limit filter.
- area: subset load balancer
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where
    :ref:`overprovisioning_factor<envoy_v3_api_field_config.endpoint.v3.ClusterLoadAssignment.Policy.overprovisioning_factor>` and
    :ref:`weighted_priority_health <envoy_v3_api_field_config.endpoint.v3.ClusterLoadAssignment.Policy.weighted_priority_health>`
    values were not respected when subset load balacing was enabled. The default values of 140 and false were always used.

    added ECDS support for :ref:` downstream network filters<envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Filter.config_discovery>`.
