behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: listener
  change: |
    undeprecated runtime key ``overload.global_downstream_max_connections`` until :ref:`downstream connections monitor
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.resource_monitors.downstream_connections.v3.DownstreamConnectionsConfig>` extension becomes stable.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: buffer
  change: |
    Fixed a bug (https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/28760) that the internal listener causes an undefined
    behavior due to the unintended release of the buffer memory.
- area: grpc
  change: |
    Fixed a bug in gRPC async client cache which intermittently causes CPU spikes due to busy loop in timer expiration.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where Datadog spans tagged as errors would not have the appropriate error property set.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where child spans produced by the Datadog tracer would have an incorrect operation name.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Fixed a bug that caused the Datadog tracing extension to drop traces that
    should be kept on account of an extracted sampling decision.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Fixed a bug in QUIC and HCM interaction which could cause use-after-free during asynchronous certificates retrieval.
    The fix is guarded by runtime ``envoy.reloadable_features.quic_fix_filter_manager_uaf``.
- area: proxy protocol
  change: |
    Fixed a crash when Envoy is configured for PROXY protocol on both a listener and cluster, and the listener receives
    a PROXY protocol header with address type LOCAL (typically used for health checks).
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed crash when HTTP request idle and per try timeouts occurs within backoff interval.
- area: url matching
  change: |
    Fixed excessive CPU utilization when using regex URL template matcher.
