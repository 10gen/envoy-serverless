behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: adaptive concurrency filter stats
  change: |
    Multiply the gradient value stat by 1000 to make it more granular (values will range between 500 and 2000).

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: tracers
  change: |
    use unary RPC calls for OpenTelemetry trace exports, rather than client-side streaming connections.

removed_config_or_runtime:
# *Normally occurs at the end of the* :ref:`deprecation period <deprecated>`
- area: http
  change: |
    Removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.allow_absolute_url_with_mixed_scheme`` runtime flag and legacy code paths.
- area: http1
  change: |
    Removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_allow_codec_error_response_after_1xx_headers`` runtime flag and legacy code paths.
- area: overload manager
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.overload_manager_error_unknown_action`` and legacy code paths.

new_features:
- area: aws_request_signing
  change: |
    Update ``aws_request_signing`` filter to support use as an upstream HTTP filter. This allows successful calculation of
    signatures after the forwarding stage has completed, particularly if the path element is modified.
- area: grpc reverse bridge
  change: |
    Change HTTP status to 200 to respect the gRPC protocol. This may cause problems for incorrect gRPC clients expecting the filter
    to preserve HTTP 1.1 responses.  This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.grpc_http1_reverse_bridge_change_http_status`` to false.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    implemented
    :ref:`request_attributes <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.request_attributes>`
    and
    :ref:`response_attributes <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.response_attributes>`
    config APIs to enable sending and receiving attributes to/from the external processing server.
- area: access log
  change: |
    added support for :ref:`%UPSTREAM_CONNECTION_ID% <config_access_log_format_upstream_connection_id>` for the upstream connection
    identifier.
