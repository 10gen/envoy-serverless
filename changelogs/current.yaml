# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: access_log
  change: |
    When emitting grpc logs, only downstream filter state was used. Now, both downstream and upstream filter states will be tried
    to find the keys configured in filter_state_objects_to_log.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: buffer
  change: |
    Fixed a bug (https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/28760) that the internal listener causes an undefined
    behavior due to the unintended release of the buffer memory.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed recursion when HTTP connection is disconnected due to a high number of premature resets.
- area: grpc
  change: |
    Fixed a bug in gRPC async client cache which intermittently causes CPU spikes due to busy loop in timer expiration.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where Datadog spans tagged as errors would not have the appropriate error property set.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where child spans produced by the Datadog tracer would have an incorrect operation name.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Fixed a bug that caused the Datadog tracing extension to drop traces that
    should be kept on account of an extracted sampling decision.
- area: proxy protocol
  change: |
    fixed a crash when Envoy is configured for PROXY protocol on both a listener and cluster, and the listener receives
    a PROXY protocol header with address type LOCAL (typically used for health checks).
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed crash when HTTP request idle and per try timeouts occurs within backoff interval.
