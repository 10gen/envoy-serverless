behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: build
  change: |
    Moved the subset, ring_hash, and maglev LB code into extensions. If you use these load balancers and override
    extensions_build_config.bzl you will need to include them explicitly.
- area: build
  change: |
    Moved xDS code extensions. If you use the xDS and override extensions_build_config.bzl you will
    need to include the new config_subscriptions explicitly.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: connection pool
  change: |
    Increase granularity mapping connection pool failures to specific stream failure reasons to make it more transparent why
    the stream is reset when a connection pool's connection fails.
- area: custom response
  change: |
    The filter now traverses matchers from most specific to least specific per filter config till a match is found for the response.
- area: http1
  change: |
    The HTTP1 server-side codec no longer considers encoding 1xx headers as
    starting the response. This allows the codec to raise protocol errors,
    sending detailed local replies instead of just closing the connection. This
    behavior can be reverted by setting runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_allow_codec_error_response_after_1xx_headers``
    to false.
- area: uhv
  change: |
    Preserve case of %-encoded triplets in the default header validator. This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.uhv_preserve_url_encoded_case`` to false, in which case %-encoded triplets are normalized
    to uppercase characters. This setting is only applicable when the Unversal Header Validator is enabled and has no effect otherwise.
- area: uhv
  change: |
    Allow malformed URL encoded triplets in the default header validator. This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.uhv_allow_malformed_url_encoding`` to false, in which case requests with malformed URL encoded triplets
    in path are rejected. This setting is only applicable when the Unversal Header Validator is enabled and has no effect otherwise.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    When :ref:`clear_route_cache <envoy_v3_api_field_service.ext_proc.v3.CommonResponse.clear_route_cache>` is set, ext_proc will check
    for header mutations beforce clearing the route cache. Failures due to this check will be counted under the
    clear_route_cache_ignored stat.
- area: aws
  change: |
    Added support for fetching credentials from the AWS credentials file, which only happens if credentials cannot be fetched
    from environment variables. This behavioral change can be reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_aws_credentials_file`` to ``false``.
- area: http cookies
  change: |
    Changed internal format of http cookie to protobuf and added expiry timestamp. Processing expired cookie
    results in selection of a new upstream host and sending a new cookie to the client. Previous format of
    the cookie is still accepted, but is planned to be obsoleted in the future.
    This behavior change can be reverted by setting
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.stateful_session_encode_ttl_in_cookie`` to ``false``.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    The Max-Age attribute of Set-Cookie HTTP response header was being assigned a value representing Seconds Since
    the Epoch, causing cookies to expire in ~53 years. This was fixed an now it is being assinged a value representing
    the number of seconds until the cookie expires.
    This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.oauth_use_standard_max_age_value`` to false.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Fix build FIPS compliance when using both FIPS mode and Wasm extensions (``--define boringssl=fips`` and ``--define wasm=v8``).
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Fix a bug where the ext_authz filter will ignore the request body when the
    :ref:`pack_as_bytes <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.BufferSettings.pack_as_bytes>` is set to true and
    HTTP authorization service is configured.
- area: router
  change: |
    Fixed the bug that updating :ref:`scope_key_builder
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.ScopedRoutes.scope_key_builder>`
    of SRDS config doesn't work and multiple HCM share the same ``scope_key_builder``.

removed_config_or_runtime:
# *Normally occurs at the end of the* :ref:`deprecation period <deprecated>`

  change: |
    removed runtime key ``envoy.reloadable_features.closer_shadow_behavior`` and legacy code paths.

new_features:
- area: access_log
  change: |
    added %ACCESS_LOG_TYPE% substitution string, to help distinguishing between access log records and when they are being
    recorded. Please refer to the access log configuration documentation for more information.
- area: http
  change: |
    added Runtime feature ``envoy.reloadable_features.max_request_headers_size_kb`` to override the default value of
    :ref:`max request headers size
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.max_request_headers_kb>`.
- area: load shed point
  change: |
    added load shed point ``envoy.load_shed_points.http_connection_manager_decode_headers`` that rejects new http streams
    by sending a local reply.
- area: load shed point
  change: |
    added load shed point ``envoy.load_shed_points.http1_server_abort_dispatch`` that rejects HTTP1 server processing of requests.
- area: load shed point
  change: |
    added load shed point ``envoy.load_shed_points.http2_server_go_away_on_dispatch`` that sends
    ``GOAWAY`` for HTTP2 server processing of requests.  When a ``GOAWAY`` frame is submitted by
    this the counter ``http2.goaway_sent`` will be incremented.
- area: matchers
  change: |
    Added :ref:`RuntimeFraction <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.matching.input_matchers.runtime_fraction.v3.RuntimeFraction>` input
    matcher. It allows matching hash of the input on a runtime key.
- area: stat_sinks
  change: |
    Added ``envoy.stat_sinks.open_telemetry`` stats_sink, that supports flushing metrics by the OTLP protocol,
    for supported Open Telemetry collectors.
- area: redis_proxy
  change: |
    added new configuration field :ref:`key_formatter
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.redis_proxy.v3.RedisProxy.PrefixRoutes.Route.key_formatter>` to format redis key.
    The field supports using %KEY% as a formatter command for substituting the redis key as part of the substitution formatter expression.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    added new configuration field :ref:`domain
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ratelimit.v3.RateLimitPerRoute.domain>` to allow for setting rate limit domains on a
    per-route basis.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    added new configuration field
    :ref:`disable_clear_route_cache <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.disable_clear_route_cache>`
    to force the ext_proc filter from clearing the route cache. Failures to clear from setting this field will be counted under the
    clear_route_cache_disabled stat.
- area: redis_proxy
  change: |
    added new field :ref:`connection_rate_limit
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.redis_proxy.v3.RedisProxy.ConnPoolSettings.connection_rate_limit>`
    to limit reconnection rate to redis server to avoid reconnection storm.

deprecated:
- area: access_log
  change: |
    deprecated (1.25.0) :ref:`intermediate_log_entry <envoy_v3_api_field_data.accesslog.v3.AccessLogCommon.intermediate_log_entry>`
    in favour of :ref:`access_log_type <envoy_v3_api_field_data.accesslog.v3.AccessLogCommon.access_log_type>`.
