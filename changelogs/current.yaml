- area: cors
  change: |
    Fix a use-after-free bug that occurs in the CORS filter if the ``origin`` header is removed between
    request header decoding and response header encoding.
- area: opentelemetry/grpc/access log
  change: |
    Fixed a bug in the open telemetry access logger. This logger now uses the
    server scope for stats instead of the listener's global scope. This fixes a
    use-after-free that can occur if the listener is drained but the cached
    grpc access logger uses the listener's global scope for stats.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Fixed a cookie validator bug that meant the HMAC calculation could be the same for different payloads.

    This prevents malicious clients from constructing credentials with permanent validity in some specific scenarios.
