behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: http
  change: |
    Flip runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.no_downgrade_to_canonical_name`` to true. Name downgrading in the
    per filter config searching will be disabled by default. This behavior can be temporarily reverted by setting
    the flag to false explicitly.
    See doc :ref:`Http filter route specific config <arch_overview_http_filters_per_filter_config>` or
    issue https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/29461 for more specific detail and examples.
- area: listener
  change: |
    undeprecated runtime key ``overload.global_downstream_max_connections`` until :ref:`downstream connections monitor
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.resource_monitors.downstream_connections.v3.DownstreamConnectionsConfig>` extension becomes stable.
- area: stats dns_filter
  change: |
    Fixed tag extraction so that :ref:`stat_prefix <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.udp.dns_filter.v3.DnsFilterConfig>`
    is properly extracted. This changes the Prometheus name from
    dns_filter_myprefix_local_a_record_answers{} to dns_filter_local_a_record_answers{envoy.dns_filter_prefix="myprefix"}.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: golang
  change: |
    Remove Protocol method from RequestHeaderMap.
    To get the protocol, please use GetProperty("request.protocol") instead.
- area: aws
  change: |
    uses http async client to fetch the credentials from EC2 instance metadata and ECS task metadata providers instead of libcurl
    which is deprecated. To revert this behavior set ``envoy.reloadable_features.use_libcurl_to_fetch_aws_credentials`` to true.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    Fixed a reported issue (https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/11004) that causes the Least
    Request load balancer policy to be unfair when the number of hosts are very small, when the number
    of hosts is smaller than the choice_count, instead of randomly selection hosts from the list, we
    perform a full scan on it to choose the host with least requests.
- area: local_rate_limit
  change: |
    Added new configuration field :ref:`rate_limited_as_resource_exhausted
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.local_ratelimit.v3.LocalRateLimit.rate_limited_as_resource_exhausted>`
    to allow for setting if rate limit grpc response should be RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED instead of the default UNAVAILABLE.
- area: filter state
  change: |
    Added config name of filter sending a local reply in filter state with key
    ``envoy.filters.network.http_connection_manager.local_reply_owner``.
    See :ref:`the well-known filter state keys <well_known_filter_state>` for more detail.
- area: http2
  change: |
    Flip the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.defer_processing_backedup_streams`` to be on by default.
    This feature improves flow control within the proxy by deferring work on the receiving end if the other
    end is backed up.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: buffer
  change: |
    Fixed a bug (https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/28760) that the internal listener causes an undefined
    behavior due to the unintended release of the buffer memory.
- area: xds
  change: |
    Fixed a bug (https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/27702) that caused ADS initialization
    to fail on the first attempt and set a back-off retry interval of up to 1 second, if ADS is
    using an Envoy Cluster for the backend. The issue was fixed to ensure that ADS initialization
    happens after the Envoy Cluster it depends upon has been properly initialized. ADS that does
    not depend on an Envoy Cluster (i.e. GoogleGrpc) is not affected by this change.
- area: grpc
  change: |
    Fixed a bug in gRPC async client cache which intermittently causes CPU spikes due to busy loop in timer expiration.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Fixed a bug that caused the Datadog tracing extension to drop traces that
    should be kept on account of an extracted sampling decision.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Fixed a bug in QUIC and HCM interaction which could cause use-after-free during asynchronous certificates retrieval.
    The fix is guarded by runtime ``envoy.reloadable_features.quic_fix_filter_manager_uaf``.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Fixed a bug causing crash if incoming redis key does not match against a prefix_route and catch_all_route is not defined.
- area: access log
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where the omit_empty_values field was not honored for access logs specifying formats via text_format_source.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Fixed content_length related issues when body mutation by external processor is enabled. ext_proc filter removes the content
    length header in 1)STREAMED BodySendMode 2) BUFFERED_PARTIAL BodySendMode and 3) BUFFERED BodySendMode + SKIP HeaderSendMode.
    This will enable chunked-encoding whenever feasible in HTTP1.1. Besides, ext_proc filter keep content length header
    in BUFFERED BodySendMode + SEND HeaderSendMode. It is now external processor's responsibility to set the content length
    correctly matched to the mutated body. if those two doesn't match, the mutation will be rejected and local reply with error
    status will be returned.
- area: dynamic_forward_proxy
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where the preresolved hostnames specified in the Dynamic Forward Proxy cluster
    config would not use the normalized hostname as the DNS cache key, which is the same key
    used for retrieval. This caused cache misses on initial use, even though the host DNS entry
    was pre-resolved. The fix is guarded by runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.normalize_host_for_preresolve_dfp_dns``,
    which defaults to true.

new_features:
- area: filters
  change: |
    Added :ref:`the Basic Auth filter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.basic_auth.v3.BasicAuth>`, which can be used to
    authenticate user credentials in the HTTP Authentication heaer defined in `RFC7617 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617>`_.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    Added :ref:`enable_full_scan <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.load_balancing_policies.least_request.v3.LeastRequest>`
    option to the least requested load balancer. If set to true, Envoy will perform a full scan on the list of hosts
    instead of using :ref:`choice_count
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.load_balancing_policies.least_request.v3.LeastRequest>`
    to select the hosts.
- area: stats
  change: |
    added :ref:`per_endpoint_stats <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.TrackClusterStats.per_endpoint_stats>` to get some metrics
    for each endpoint in a cluster.
- area: jwt
  change: |
    The jwt filter can now serialize non-primitive custom claims when maping claims to headers.
    These claims will be serialized as JSON and encoded as Base64.
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    added support to TCP Proxy for recording the latency in ``UpstreamTiming`` from when the first
    initial connection to the upstream cluster was attempted to when either the
    connection was successfully established or the filiter failed to initialize
    any connection to the upstream.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    Ratelimit supports setting the HTTP status that is returned to the client when the ratelimit server
    returns an error or cannot be reached with :ref:`status_on_error
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ratelimit.v3.RateLimit.status_on_error>`
    configuration flag.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Added support for configuring resource detectors on the OpenTelemetry tracer.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Added support to configure a sampler for the OpenTelemetry tracer.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    New config parameter :ref:`charge_cluster_response_stats
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz.charge_cluster_response_stats>`
    for not incrementing cluster statistics on ext_authz response. Default true, no behavior change.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    forward :ref:`filter_metadata <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.Metadata.filter_metadata>` selected by
    :ref:`route_metadata_context_namespaces
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz.route_metadata_context_namespaces>`
    and :ref:`typed_filter_metadata <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.Metadata.typed_filter_metadata>` selected by
    :ref:`route_typed_metadata_context_namespaces
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz.route_typed_metadata_context_namespaces>`
    from the metadata of the selected route to external auth service.
    This metadata propagation is independent from the dynamic metadata from connection and request.
- area: ext_authz_filter
  change: |
    added :ref:`with_request_body
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.CheckSettings.with_request_body>` to optionally override
    the default behavior of sending the request body to the authorization server from the per-route filter.
- area: grpc async client
  change: |
    added :ref:`max_cached_entry_idle_duration
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.Bootstrap.GrpcAsyncClientManagerConfig.max_cached_entry_idle_duration>`
    to control the cached grpc client eviction time in the cache.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    Ratelimit supports optional additional prefix to use when emitting statistics with :ref:`stat_prefix

    response trailers in :ref:`UdpTunnelingConfig
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.udp.udp_proxy.v3.UdpProxyConfig.UdpTunnelingConfig.propagate_response_trailers>` to
    the downstream info filter state.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Provide initial span attributes to a sampler used in the OpenTelemetry tracer.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    implemented
    :ref:`request_attributes <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.request_attributes>`
    and
    :ref:`response_attributes <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.response_attributes>`
    config APIs to enable sending and receiving attributes from/to the external processing server.
