behavior_changes:
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    OAuth filter now URL-encodes URL in query parameters. These query parameters are decoded, leaving intact character
    sequences that must remain encoded in URLs. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.oauth_use_url_encoding`` to false.
- area: admin
  change: |
    Adds a new admin stats format option 'html-active' to display a periodically updated list of the top most frequently
    changed stats.
- area: build
  change: |
    moved the tcp, http, and grpc health checkers to extensions. If you use these and override extensions_build_config.bzl
    you will now need to include them explicitly.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: event
  change: |
    ``Event::PostCb`` type changed from ``std::function`` to ``absl::AnyInvocable``. This makes it possible
    to capture unique_ptrs in dispatcher callbacks. If you have used ``Event::PostCb`` as shorthand for
    ``std::function<void()>`` in a non-post-callback-related context, you will have to change that.
    If you have used ``std::function`` in a mock dispatcher, you will have to change that to ``Event::PostCb``
    and may need to make it moveable. See https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/26296 for a variety of
    example fixes.
- area: build
  change: |
    Moved the REST config subscripton code into extensions. If you use REST for config updates and override
    extensions_build_config.bzl you will now need to include it explicitly.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Access logging is now deferred to the QUIC ack listener, and roundtrip response time is added as a downstream timing
    metric. New runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.quic_defer_logging_to_ack_listener`` can be used for revert this
    behavior.
- area: healthcheck
  change: |
    If active HC is enabled and a host is ejected by outlier detection, a successful active health check unejects the host
    and consider it healthy. This also clears all the outlier detection counters. This behavior change can be reverted by
    setting ``envoy.reloadable_features_successful_active_health_check_uneject_host`` to ``false``.
- area: local_ratelimit
  change: |
    Tokens from local descriptor's token buckets are burned before tokens from the default token bucket.
- area: http stream
  change: |
    Extended the lifetime of the protocol agnostic stream object to correct discrepancies between what is access logged and
    what occurred with the protocol specific stream. This behavior change can be reverted by setting
    ``envoy_reloadable_features_expand_agnostic_stream_lifetime`` to ``false``.
- area: http2
  change: |
    Request authorities are now validated with a library function from QUICHE rather than nghttp2. This behavior change can
    be reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_validate_authority_with_quiche`` to ``false``.
- area: lua
  change: |
    dropped moonjit support.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Make the :ref:`grpc service <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.grpc_service>`
    required.
- area: http2
  change: |
    Metadata is parsed with the QUICHE HPACK library, rather than nghttp2. This behavior change can be reverted by setting
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_decode_metadata_with_quiche`` to ``false``.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    Changed HTTP/1 and HTTP/3 upstream streams not to disable reading (in case where downstream buffer reaches high
    watermark) till the full response headers have been received. This fixes a bug where Envoy upstream timeouts were not
    correctly adjusting to the fact that the response headers have already been sent from upstream. This behavior change can
    be reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.upstream_wait_for_response_headers_before_disabling_read`` to
    ``false``.
- area: custom response
  change: |
    Changed how the uri for redirect policy is specified. It can now be specified either as a single fully qualified string,
    or by specifying individual components of the uri.
- area: matchers
  change: |
    Moved all of the network input matchers to extensions. If you use network matchers and override
    extensions_build_config.bzl you will now need to include them explicitly.
- area: access_logs
  change: |
    Using %DURATION% in access logs will either resolve the total duration of the stream, or mid-stream duration.
    This is useful to track stream duration with periodic access logs.
- area: matchers
  change: |
    Added dynamic metadata to the MatchingData object to enable writing matcher_tree input objects that can parse provided
    dynamic metadata.
- area: skywalking
  change: |
    If sw8 header is invalid, skywalking extension will create a new trace context and a null span respectively when
    sampling is enabled and disabled.
- area: http3
  change: |
    Convert HTTP/3 extended connect to/from HTTP/1 upgrade. This behavior change can be reverted by setting
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.use_http3_header_normalisation`` to ``false``.
- area: http
  change: |
    prohibit route refresh after the response headers have been sent,  and clear the cached route table to more
    aggressively free memory. This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.prohibit_route_refresh_after_response_headers_sent`` to false.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Ext_authz will add ``x-envoy-auth-failure-mode-allowed`` header when ``failure_mode_allow`` is enable.
    This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.http_ext_auth_failure_mode_allow_header_add`` to false.

bug_fixes:
- area: http
  change: |
    sanitization of the referer header has been relaxed to allow relative URLs, and also tightened to remove referers
    containing userinfo or fragment components, as documented here :ref:`here <config_http_conn_man_headers_referer>`. This
    behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.http_allow_partial_urls_in_referer`` to false.
- area: stats
  change: |
    now updating upstream total connection stats as happy eyeballs connections are created.
- area: eds
  change: |
    added ``envoy.reloadable_features.multiplex_eds`` to disable eds multiplexing. Eds multiplexing is enabled by default,
    so that all subscriptions for the same resource type and management server reuse a single channel/mux. When eds
    multiplexing is disabled each subscription uses a dedicated channel/mux.
- area: router
  change: |
    fixed the bug that custom tags of the route metadata type are not set for upstream spans.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    ensure the route configuration will be used to overwrite global configuration when processing the local reply.
- area: router
  change: |
    fixed outlier detection ejections caused by opened circuit breakers.
- area: dependency
  change: |
    Add boringssl patch to resolve CVE-2023-0286. Note that the FIPS build is not patched/fixed.
- area: access log
  change: |
    in JSON logs, port numbers were logged as strings and are now logged as numbers (``%DOWNSTREAM_LOCAL_PORT%``,
    ``%DOWNSTREAM_REMOTE_PORT%``, ``%DOWNSTREAM_DIRECT_REMOTE_PORT%``, ``%UPSTREAM_LOCAL_PORT%``,
    ``%UPSTREAM_REMOTE_PORT%``). This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.format_ports_as_numbers`` to false.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Let onData always raise StopIterationAndWatermark when waiting for headers response, to avoid http errors (413 on
    request path, and 500 on response path) when data size goes above high watermark.
- area: http filter
  change: |
    Fix possible illegal memory access in the header_mutaion filter when the request is aborted before the request headers
    are received completely.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    Initialize upstream network read filters via their ``onNewConnection()`` callback once the upstream connection has been
    established even if there is no data available for reading on the new upstream connection. This behavior change can be
    reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.initialize_upstream_filters`` to ``false``.
- area: ecds
  change: |
    Delay listener activation until after the new ECDS filter configuration is created. Previously, listeners were activated
    with the xDS acceptance before the new extension config is fully processed.
- area: dubbo
  change: |
    Fix a bug that the dubbo proxy will treat the response with status 80 as a illegal response.

    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.jwt_authn.v3.JwtProvider.failed_status_in_metadata>` to support setting the
    JWT authentication failure status code and message in dynamic metadata.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    added the support :ref:`override_message_timeout
    <envoy_v3_api_field_service.ext_proc.v3.ProcessingResponse.override_message_timeout>` for the ext_proc server to send
    back a message to Envoy to extend the ext_proc timer. added the field :ref:`max_message_timeout
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.max_message_timeout>` for specifying the max
    override_message_timeout could be sent back by the ext_proc server.

  change: |
    add :ref:`flush access log on connected
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.tcp_proxy.v3.TcpProxy.flush_access_log_on_connected>` to allow recording
    an access log entry on the connection open event. This option does not require periodic access logging enabled, and the
    other way around.
- area: http
  change: |
    add :ref:`periodic access logging
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.access_log_flush_interval>`
    to http access logs for long-lived requests (Websockets, CONNECT, etc). :ref:`%DURATION%
    <config_access_log_format_duration>` will be empty for mid-request logs. Enabling this may affect access loggers and
    filters that register as access loggers that expect to be called only once.

  change: |
    added access log support for ``%STREAM_STATE%`` command operator. Using the command operator will extract a value
    representing the state of the stream. Access logs at the beginning of the stream will have 'Started' value. Periodic
    access logs during an active stream, will have 'InProgress' value. Default access log, at the end of a stream will have
    'Ended' value. In case the stream has not started yet, the value will be null.
- area: stream info
  change: |
    added the latency for how long an upstream request spends waiting for the connection pool callback to
    ``UpstreamTiming``.

    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.AuthorizationRequest.allowed_headers>` in favour of
    :ref:`ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz.allowed_headers
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz.allowed_headers>`.
