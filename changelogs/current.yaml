- area: connection pool
  change: |
    Increase granularity mapping connection pool failures to specific stream failure reasons to make it more transparent why
    the stream is reset when a connection pool's connection fails.
- area: custom response
  change: |
    The filter now traverses matchers from most specific to least specific per filter config till a match is found for the response.
- area: uhv
  change: |
    Preserve case of %-encoded triplets in the default header validator. This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.uhv_preserve_url_encoded_case`` to false, in which case %-encoded triplets are normalized
    to uppercase characters. This setting is only applicable when the Unversal Header Validator is enabled and has no effect otherwise.
- area: uhv
  change: |
    Allow malformed URL encoded triplets in the default header validator. This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.uhv_allow_malformed_url_encoding`` to false, in which case requests with malformed URL encoded triplets
    in path are rejected. This setting is only applicable when the Unversal Header Validator is enabled and has no effect otherwise.
