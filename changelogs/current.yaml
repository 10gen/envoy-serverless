- area: healthcheck
  change: |
    If active HC is enabled and a host is ejected by outlier detection, a successful active health check unejects the host and consider it healthy. This also clears all the outlier detection counters. This behavior change can be reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features_successful_active_health_check_uneject_host`` to ``false``.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: eds
  change: |
    added ``envoy.reloadable_features.multiplex_eds`` to disable eds multiplexing. Eds multiplexing is enabled by default, so that all subscriptions for the same resource type and management server reuse a single channel/mux.
    When eds multiplexing is disabled each subscription uses a dedicated channel/mux.

- area: http
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_delay_keepalive_timeout`` and legacy code paths.
