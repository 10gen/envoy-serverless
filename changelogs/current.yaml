behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: build
  change: |
    Moved the subset LB code into extensions. If you use the subset LB and override extensions_build_config.bzl you will
    need to include it explicitly.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: connection pool
  change: |
    Increase granularity mapping connection pool failures to specific stream failure reasons to make it more transparent why
    the stream is reset when a connection pool's connection fails.
- area: custom response
  change: |
    The filter now traverses matchers from most specific to least specific per filter config till a match is found for the response.
- area: uhv
  change: |
    Preserve case of %-encoded triplets in the default header validator. This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.uhv_preserve_url_encoded_case`` to false, in which case %-encoded triplets are normalized
    to uppercase characters. This setting is only applicable when the Unversal Header Validator is enabled and has no effect otherwise.
- area: uhv
  change: |
    Allow malformed URL encoded triplets in the default header validator. This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.uhv_allow_malformed_url_encoding`` to false, in which case requests with malformed URL encoded triplets
    in path are rejected. This setting is only applicable when the Unversal Header Validator is enabled and has no effect otherwise.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: tls
  change: |
    Fix build FIPS compliance when using both FIPS mode and Wasm extensions (``--define boringssl=fips`` and ``--define wasm=v8``).

- area: upstream
  change: |
    removed runtime key ``envoy.reloadable_features.fix_hash_key`` and legacy code paths.
- area: logging
  change: |
    removed runtime key ``envoy.reloadable_features.correct_remote_address`` and legacy code paths.
- area: http
  change: |
    removed runtime key ``envoy.reloadable_features.http_response_half_close`` and legacy code paths.
- area: udp
  change: |
    removed runtime key ``envoy.reloadable_features.udp_proxy_connect`` and legacy code paths.

new_features:
- area: access_log
  change: |
    added %ACCESS_LOG_TYPE% substitution string, to help distinguishing between access log records and when they are being
    recorded. Please refer to the access log configuration documentation for more information.
- area: http
  change: |
    added Runtime feature ``envoy.reloadable_features.max_request_headers_size_kb`` to override the default value of
    :ref:`max request headers size
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.max_request_headers_kb>`.
- area: load shed point
  change: |
    added load shed point ``envoy.load_shed_points.http_connection_manager_decode_headers`` that rejects new http streams
    by sending a local reply.
- area: matchers
  change: |
    Added :ref:`RuntimeFraction <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.matching.input_matchers.runtime_fraction.v3.RuntimeFraction>` input
    matcher. It allows matching hash of the input on a runtime key.
- area: stat_sinks
  change: |
    Added ``envoy.stat_sinks.open_telemetry`` stats_sink, that supports flushing metrics by the OTLP protocol,
    for supported Open Telemetry collectors.
- area: redis_proxy
  change: |
    added new configuration field :ref:`key_formatter
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.redis_proxy.v3.RedisProxy.PrefixRoutes.Route.key_formatter>` to format redis key.
    The field supports using %KEY% as a formatter command for substituting the redis key as part of the substitution formatter expression.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    added new configuration field :ref:`domain
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ratelimit.v3.RateLimitPerRoute.domain>` to allow for setting rate limit domains on a
    per-route basis.
- area: redis_proxy
  change: |
    added new field :ref:`connection_rate_limit
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.redis_proxy.v3.RedisProxy.ConnPoolSettings.connection_rate_limit>`
    to limit reconnection rate to redis server to avoid reconnection storm.

deprecated:
- area: access_log
  change: |
    deprecated (1.25.0) :ref:`intermediate_log_entry <envoy_v3_api_field_data.accesslog.v3.AccessLogCommon.intermediate_log_entry>`
    in favour of :ref:`access_log_type <envoy_v3_api_field_data.accesslog.v3.AccessLogCommon.access_log_type>`.
