# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: http
  change: |

    by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.lowercase_scheme`` to ``false``.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: cors
  change: |
    Fix a use-after-free bug that occurs in the CORS filter if the ``origin`` header is removed between
    request header decoding and response header encoding.
- area: http
  change: |
    Switched Envoy internal scheme checks from case sensitive to case insensitive. This behaviorial change can be temporarily
    reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.handle_uppercase_scheme`` to ``false``.
- area: opentelemetry/grpc/access log
  change: |
    Fixed a bug in the open telemetry access logger. This logger now uses the
    server scope for stats instead of the listener's global scope. This fixes a
    use-after-free that can occur if the listener is drained but the cached
    gRPC access logger uses the listener's global scope for stats.
- area: oauth
  change: |
    Fixed a cookie validator bug that HMAC caluation could be same for different payloads.
    This will avoid malicious client is able to construct credentials with permanent validity in some specific scenario.
