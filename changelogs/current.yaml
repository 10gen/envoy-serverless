  change: |
    Preserve case of %-encoded triplets in the default header validator. This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.uhv_preserve_url_encoded_case`` to false, in which case %-encoded triplets are normalized
    to uppercase characters. This setting is only applicable when the Unversal Header Validator is enabled and has no effect otherwise.
